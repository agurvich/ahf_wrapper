I am attaching a zip file with Amiga Halo finder that i modified
myself (I can explain to you exactly what I modified if you like, but
it would take a while). 

To compile, you will need to do

Make AHF
Make MergerTree
Make MergerTrace

I am attaching a sample AMIGA input file that i used for the halo
finding for your simulations.

to make a halo catalog for a single snapshot
./bin/AHF AMIGA.INPUT189

then when you have created halo catalog for each snapshot, you run:

/home1/01708/cfaucher/repos/cafg_python/zooms-analysis/sasha_halo/ahf-v1.0-069/bin/MergerTree N

This needs to be run in the same directory as the sim directory.

where N is the number of snapshots for which you want to create merger
trees. You need a file called MTSnaps.txt in the same directory with N
lines. Each line in this file should be the path to the halo catalog
"particles" file that Amiga creates for putput

for example, my MTSnaps looks something like
"
Pep/snap080RPep.z4.500.AHF
Pep/snap081RPep.z4.450.AHF
Pep/snap082RPep.z4.400.AHF
Pep/snap083RPep.z4.350.AHF
Pep/snap084RPep.z4.300.AHF
Pep/snap085RPep.z4.250.AHF
"
Where "Pep" is the subdirectory where I store the AMIGA outputs.
ce_ID.txt MTSnaps.txt
If this step succeeds, you want to run:

/home1/01708/cfaucher/repos/cafg_python/zooms-analysis/sasha_halo/ahf-v1.0-069/bin/MergerTrace
Mtrace_ID.txt MTSnaps.txt

where Mtrace_ID.txt  is a file with the number of a halo which you
want to follow from the first entry of MTSnaps.txt to the last entry. 

for example, my Mtrace_ID.txt file looks like this: 
"
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
"
to trace the halos ranked from 0 to 6 in overdensity in the earliest
snapshot listed in MTSnaps.txt 

Also attaching the hdf5-to-snap python converter since AMIGA doesn't
read HDF5.

python convallsnaps.py snap_dir

finally, to get to the file format that i sent you before, you need to
run simplify_halo.py on the output files from MergerTrace to make them
a bit more manageable. 

simplify_halo.py snap_dir

And then smooth halo files to avoid e.g. jumps in virial radius time
time:
python smoothallhalos.py
